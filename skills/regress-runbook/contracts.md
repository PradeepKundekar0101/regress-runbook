# Subagent contracts

Each subagent's final message must be a single JSON object and nothing else: first character `{`, last character `}`, no code fences.
Every number inside `findings` must also appear as an evidence id in `evidence_ids`; say "see ev_x" instead of restating figures.
Use `status: "insufficient"` with `unknowns` filled in when the tools could not answer.

Common shape:

```json
{
  "contract_version": 1,
  "role": "<role>",
  "incident_id": "<incident id>",
  "status": "complete | insufficient",
  "findings": {},
  "evidence_ids": ["ev_..."],
  "unknowns": ["..."]
}
```

## what_changed

Tools: `regress.get_changes`, `regress.get_prompt`, `regress.get_route`.
Find every prompt label move and route change in the last 60 minutes with its commit message, and diff the suspect prompt version against the previous one.

```json
"findings": {
  "changes": [{"change_id": 0, "ts": "", "kind": "prompt|route", "from": "", "to": "", "commit_message": "", "by_regress": false}],
  "prompt_diff_summary": "which instruction blocks were removed or reworded",
  "live": {"prompt_version": 0, "model": ""}
}
```

## segments

Tools: `regress.localize`, `regress.get_traces`.
Say which change segment explains which alarm, and which customer categories degraded most.

```json
"findings": {
  "candidates": [{"dimension": "prompt_version|model", "value": "", "explains": [], "still_alarming_without_it": []}],
  "unexplained": [],
  "worst_categories": [{"category": "", "evidence": "ev_..."}],
  "example_trace_ids": []
}
```

## impact

Tools: `regress.get_window_stats` (group_by `model` and `prompt_version`), `regress.get_user_signals`.
Quantify latency, cost and customer impact, and list what did not move (the ruled-out list).

```json
"findings": {
  "moved": [{"signal": "", "evidence": "ev_..."}],
  "unchanged": [{"signal": "", "evidence": "ev_..."}],
  "user_signals": {"thumbs_down_current": "ev_...", "talk_to_human_current": "ev_...", "available": true}
}
```

## replay

Tools: `regress.get_changes`, `regress.get_traces`, `regress.replay_generate`, the sandbox (code mode: `regress.get_replay_outputs`, `regress.submit_replay_report`).
Pick the suspect arm from the most recent change before the incident (a prompt version or a model) and the baseline arm from that change's `from` value; keep the other dimension at its live value.
Call `replay_generate` directly (20 inputs; 10 if either arm is a gpt-5 or o-series reasoning model).
Then adapt `replay_harness.py` from this skill and run it in the sandbox: it fetches the outputs, scores them, and submits the report.
The server re-scores the same outputs; if it rejects your numbers, fix the scorer to match the rules in the harness, do not edit numbers by hand.

```json
"findings": {
  "replay_id": "rp_...",
  "baseline": {"prompt_version": 0, "model": ""},
  "suspect": {"prompt_version": 0, "model": ""},
  "verified": true,
  "coverage": "n/m",
  "eval_gap": "ev_...",
  "latency_ratio": "ev_...",
  "cost_ratio": "ev_..."
}
```
